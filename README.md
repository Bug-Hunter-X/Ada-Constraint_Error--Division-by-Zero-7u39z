# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: division by zero, which raises a `Constraint_Error` exception. The example includes exception handling to gracefully manage this scenario. 

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to handle the exception properly.  Understanding exception handling is critical for robust Ada applications.
